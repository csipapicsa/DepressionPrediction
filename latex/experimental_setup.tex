\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Feature Selection - DT}

For finding the best features which corrolate with the binary depression score ANOVA, Random Forest (RF) and Mutual information was used. Despite the unbalanced dataset [TODO: Cite something about it] Using the top features selected by ANOVA produced the best result. 

\subsection{Model Parameters TCC}

The implementation of the TCC model is based on the original paper \cite{tcc}. some model parameters are lowered simply due to the HW limitations (to be able to fit into VRAM wiht limit of 4GB). The model is trained with a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 0.0001, and a maximum of 40 epochs.
