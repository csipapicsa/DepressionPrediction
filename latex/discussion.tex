\section{Discussion}

Blablabla

Data cleaning maybe helps for the accuracy, however I wanted to test these methods in real world scenarios when the audio is possibly noisy. 

As Baily\cite{bailey2021gender} states that the DAIC woz men women bias leads to performance difference in case of ML models. 

\subsection{Key Findings}
- simple decision tree reaches x accuracy in case of binary classification

- Cross validation of the two dataset results this and that -> performs well, not well, whatever
\subsection{Limitations}
- Hopefully there is not

- Using audio only

- Which features are extracted
