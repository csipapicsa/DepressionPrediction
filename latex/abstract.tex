This study explores the utility of vocal biomarkers for depression diagnosis through binary classification methods mapped to binary. Using audio features extracted from speech in the DAIC-WOZ and EATD-Corpus datasets, I employ decision tree algorithms and cnn [what is cnn?] models to evaluate their predictive accuracy. I have reached poor accuracy. My results indicate that using PHQ8 questinoryy provide better results. The study highlights the challenges of using audio data for depression detection and the need for further research to improve model performance and generalizability.
